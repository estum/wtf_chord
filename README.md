‘WTF Chord?’ is the Ruby guitar chords generator library & cli tool, which also contains some abstraction for musical mathematics. Chords generator is a common but a not only mission, the library is ready for extending for generating scales.

Some features:

* Tones math methods.

    $ wtfchord Dm -n 10 --output=simple
    Dm (D - F - A)

    [ × × 0 2 3 1 ]
    [ × 5 3 2 3 1 ]
    [ × 5 3 2 3 5 ]
    [ × 5 3 7 3 5 ]
    [ × 5 7 7 6 5 ]
    [ 10 8 7 7 6 10 ]
    [ 10 8 7 7 10 10 ]

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment. Run `bundle exec wtf_chord` to use the gem in this directory, ignoring other installed copies of this gem.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
